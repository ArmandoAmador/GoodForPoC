  <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

  <p>All events run by Good for People of Color are safe spaces where you can express yourself without fear of judgment or harassment. All participants and visitors are expected to treat other participants, visitors, staff, and the general public with respect. Under the umbrella of respect, we expect all participants be mindful of their speech and behaviors both in person and on social media. Particularly, we want to remind participants and visitors to refrain from making assumptions about another's identity, experience, and preferred pronouns. Additionally, we expect that you will not photograph or record anyone without consent.</p>

  <h4>Please remember:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>“No” means no.</li>
    <li>“Stop” means stop.</li>
    <li>“Go away” means go away.</li>
    <li>Attire is not consent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Social Rules</h3>
  <p><strong>The Shower Clap:</strong> If there’s a lot of noise in the room, we’ll employ the Shower Clap. (We’ll always demonstrate what this is at the beginning of events.) </p>
  <p><strong>One Mic:</strong> When someone is speaking, please respect them by listening with open ears to what they have to say. When it’s your turn, you can speak up and the same respect will be given to you. </p>
  <p><strong>Cordially Disagree:</strong> While we can’t all be expected to always agree with each other, we have to make space for others and their opinions. Even if you don’t agree, you can agree to disagree with someone else, regardless of what you believe is right.  (<strong>Note:</strong> If what you disagree with falls into the category of assault, harassment, or abuse, please report that to us so that we can resolve the situation swiftly.)</p>
