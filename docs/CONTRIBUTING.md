# Contributing to Good for PoC

Weâ€™re so happy to have your help! If you haven't already, [join us on Gitter](https://gitter.im/GoodForPoC/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link). We want an active community of people contributing to this project!

## What we need help with
Please [view the roadmap](https://github.com/GoodForPoC/website/projects/1) to see what contributions are needed before modifying code. We want this project to continue growing and help support people of color in tech around the globe!
You can report bugs using the Issues tab. Please make sure your issue has yet to be reported before opening a new one. If you need to open a new issue, be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a screenshot or code sample showing the bug.

## Coding conventions
- Please indent using two spaces (soft tabs).
- When writing CSS, add a new line between brackets and CSS rule definitions. This also applies to JavaScript function definitions.
- We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and between CSS identifiers and brackets (`.example {`).
- Please consider those who will be reading your code. We hope beginners and experts will both contribute to this project.

## Testing & quality assurance (QA)

We strongly believe in test-driven development and would like help implementing testing as part of our development process. In the meantime, here are two things you can do to make contribution easy for everyone:

- Comment your code so other contributors can understand what it does.
- Make sure you use a linter to fix any and all JavaScript and CSS errors.

## Submitting changes
Please open a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done and screenshots if applicable. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits include relevant descriptions of your changes.

## Thank you!
