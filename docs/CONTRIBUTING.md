# Contributing to Good for PoC

We’re so happy to have your help! Thank you. If you haven't already, [join us on Gitter](https://gitter.im/GoodForPoC/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link). We would love to have an active community of people contributing to this project! Remember to [view our code of conduct](https://github.com/GoodForPoC/website/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating.

## What we need help with
Please [view the roadmap](https://github.com/GoodForPoC/website/projects/1) to see what contributions are needed before modifying code. We want this project to continue growing and help support people of color in tech around the globe!
You can report bugs using the Issues tab. Please make sure your issue has yet to be reported before opening a new one. If you need to open a new issue, be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a screenshot or code sample showing the bug.

## How to create your changes
- Once you’ve identified an area that needs help, make a new branch on your local copy of this repository. [Read more about branching in the git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).
- Make all of your changes in that branch.
- Test your code and ensure that it aligns with the standards below.
- Commit the relevant changes and push your branch to the remote repository.

## Coding conventions
- Please indent using two spaces (soft tabs).
- When writing CSS, add a new line between brackets and CSS rule definitions. This also applies to JavaScript function definitions.
- We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and between CSS identifiers and brackets (`.example {`).
- Please consider those who will be reading your code. We hope beginners and experts will both contribute to this project.
- Include relevant descriptions of your changes in commit messages.

## Testing & quality assurance (QA)

We strongly believe in test-driven development and would like help implementing testing as part of our development process. In the meantime, here are two things you can do to make contribution easy for everyone:

- Comment your code so other contributors can understand what it does.
- Make sure you use a linter to fix any and all JavaScript and CSS errors.

## Submitting changes
When you're ready to merge your changes into the master branch, open a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) in the project via GitHub. Make sure it has a clear list of what you've done and screenshots – we've created a handy template to make the submission process as easy as possible. Please make sure your submissions follow our coding conventions (above).

Sometimes, reviewers will provide feedback on your project changes. Please include any feedback you receive from peers during the review process and update your pull request appropriately. Once approved, your pull request will be approved and deployed.

## Thank you!
