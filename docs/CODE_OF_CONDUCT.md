# Good for PoC Contributor’s Code of Conduct

Communities organized by Good for People of Color are inclusive, safe spaces where you can contribute to open source projects without fear of harmful judgment or harassment. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). All contributors and moderators are expected to treat other contributors, moderators, admins, and the general public with respect.

Under the umbrella of respect, we expect all community members to be mindful of their behavior in person, on social media, on community forums and chatrooms, as well as within Github project repositories. Particularly, we want to remind community members to refrain from making assumptions about another's identity, experience, and preferred pronouns.

We invite all those who contribute to Good for PoC's projects to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## Expected behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- In moments of conflict, respectfully agree to disagree (unless someone is being harassed).
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

### Harassment policy

No form of harassment or assault will be tolerated. This includes: physical, written, or verbal threats; unwelcome attention; stalking; pushing, shoving, or use of physical force; behavior that creates a disturbance or is dangerous, including lewd or generally offensive behavior or language; using sexually explicit or offensive language or conduct; excessive profanity; obscene gestures; use of racial, religious, sexual, gender, ability, or ethnic slurs.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Those who do not comply will be swlftly ejected from events and online community spaces such as forums, chatrooms, and Github project repositories. Depending on the severity of the violation, we may choose to report transgressors to the authorities.

## Reporting violations

If you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, please contact us as soon as possible. If you see someone being treated with disrespect, please speak up or get a moderator involved. When reporting a violation, we request that you share whatever details can be provided. Names of those who report conflicts will not be revealed to transgressors, and we will work with everyone separately to resolve conflicts.
Concerns or violation reports can be privately submitted [email us](mailto:hello@goodforpocin.tech?Subject=[Code%20of%20conduct%20violation]%20description%20here) or privately by contacting Amélie Lamont, Catt Small, or Jacky Alciné.

## Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occuring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

*This code of conduct was partially derived from the [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/).*
