# Good for PoC Contributor’s Code of Conduct

Communities organized by Good for People of Color are safe spaces where you can contribute to open source projects without fear of harmful judgment or harassment. All contributors and moderators are expected to treat other contributors, moderators, admins, and the general public with respect.
Under the umbrella of respect, we expect all community members to be mindful of their behavior in person, on social media, on community forums and chatrooms, as well as within Github project repositories. Particularly, we want to remind community members to refrain from making assumptions about another's identity, experience, and preferred pronouns.

## Disagreements

We can’t all be expected to always agree with each other. Regardless of our own opinions, we have to make space for others and their beliefs. In moments of conflict, consider respectfully agreeing to disagree with other members when a standstill is reached. 
Please note that if someone is committing assault, harassment, or abuse, we will resolve the situation swiftly.

## Harassment

No form of harassment or assault will be tolerated. This includes: physical, written, or verbal threats; unwelcome attention; stalking; pushing, shoving, or use of physical force; behavior that creates a disturbance or is dangerous, including lewd or generally offensive behavior or language; using sexually explicit or offensive language or conduct; excessive profanity; obscene gestures; use of racial, religious, sexual, gender, ability, or ethnic slurs.
Those who violate this policy will be ejected from events and online community spaces such as forums, chatrooms, and Github project repositories. Depending on the severity of the violation, we may choose to report transgressors to the authorities.

## Reporting violations

If you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, please contact us as soon as possible. If you see someone being treated with disrespect, please speak up or get a moderator involved. When reporting a violation, we request that you share whatever details can be provided. Names of those who report conflicts will not be revealed to transgressors, and we will work with everyone separately to resolve conflicts.
Concerns or violation reports can be privately submitted [email us](mailto:hello@goodforpocin.tech?Subject=[Code%20of%20conduct%20violation]%20description%20here) or privately contacting moderators.
