  <h1>How to Help</h1>

  <p>We are honored and excited to know that you want to help out Good for PoC.</p>

  <p>There are a few ways you can help out.</p>

  <h2>Donate</h2>
  <p>Donations help us better the industry for people of color &amp; create a more diverse workforce.</p>

  <p>This isn’t work we can do by ourselves – we’re only a team of 3. If you appreciate the work we are doing, please consider supporting us by helping to cover labor and infrastructural costs of running this project.</p>

  <p>You can donate to our cause once via <a href="https://www.paypal.me/GoodforPoC" target="_blank">PayPal</a> or monthly via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/goodforpoc" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.</p>

  <h2>Volunteer</h2>
  <p>We’re always looking for people who are interested in helping out with Good for PoC. Either at events, adding content to the site, or with spreading the word.</p>

  <p>If you’re interested in helping us out, <a href="mailto:hello@goodforpocin.tech" target="_blank">shoot us an email</a> with details about yourself and why you want to help out.</p>
