# Good for PoC

Good for PoC is creating a list of inclusive companies for people of color in tech. It was founded by Amélie Lamont, Catt Small and Jacky Alciné. After running for 2 years by ourselves, we realized we needed help. This project is now open source. Please [view the roadmap](http://...) to understand what kinds of contributions we are looking for.
