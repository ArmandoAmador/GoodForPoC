<div class="company-results_happiness">
  <h3>How does this company ensure that employees of color are happy?</h3>

  <p><strong>Submission 1:</strong> “Transparency. Quarterly dinners where any staff member can ask questions and call out issues they see in the company. Yearly surveys to measure staff happiness and effectiveness of diversity and inclusion efforts.”</p>

  <p><strong>Submission 2:</strong> “Every 6 months, we do a diversity survey to ensure this and to always improve. Also, every quarter, we have a quarterly dinner in which anyone can submit anonymous questions for the C-Level team and board members to answer.”</p>
</div>

<div class="company-results_nextsteps">
  <h3>What next steps are being taken by this company to make it more diverse and inclusive?</h3>

  <p>“The new HR manager holds open office hours every week to allow employees to voice concerns. They are also putting more of a focus on defining "culture fit" and employing unbiased hiring practices (ie. removing gender pronouns from job applications).”</p>

  <p>“There is a concerted effort to hire more people of color (especially women of color) into leadership and C-level positions to diversify from the top down. Managers will be going through a management training to make sure they are well trained at the skill of managing.”</p>

  <p>“The company also just instituted an annual staff happiness survey that has a specific section on diversity and inclusion. This will allow the company to evaluate how they are doing in these areas and highlight places where they can do better.”</p>

## How you can join

<div class="company-results_hiringprocess">
  <h3>What was the hiring process like?</h3>
  <p><strong>Submission 1:</strong>“If you get approved by first round interview (usually with direct hire and HR manager), you come in for speed interviews (meeting with 2-3 staff members at a time for about 5 rounds of 5 min interviews). After that process, you will then meet with people on your team for another potential round or just go into an all staff interview where you stay for about 4 hours to meet the staff at large.”</p>

  <p><strong>Submission 2:</strong>“There will be a homework assignment given to you by the person who would be your manager. The homework will be challenging, but should be something you can complete in one day. The team will review your homework and you will probably do a preliminary interview with the manager you would work with.

  <p>If all looks good, you will be invited to do an all-staff interview. It takes a couple of hours, you get interviewed in groups of three by all the DoSomething.org staff. It's the longest and most social (lol) part of the process but it also give you a really good idea about the people you will be working with here and they get to know you better as well. If all goes well, you’re hired!”</p>
