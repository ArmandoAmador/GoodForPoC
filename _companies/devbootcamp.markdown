  ### How does this company ensure that employees of color are happy?

  According to the submitter, Dev Bootcamp has an “active and respected Diversity Circle” that “processes tensions around diversity and recommends institutional changes as needed”. In addition to the Diversity Circle, there are also other initiatives: “students of color have tri-weekly PoC lunches to caucus and connect around the realities of being underrepresented in tech; scheduling is modular and highly flexible to allow for team members to handle human obligations outside of work as others temporarily pick up the slack.
</div>

### What next steps are being taken by this company to make it more diverse and inclusive?

  Dev Bootcamp is currently auditing “internal diversity numbers with an eye on reaching parity across all roles and locations”. They’re also looking to diversify hiring methods by “encouraging employees to reach out to underrepresented friends and acquaintances to fill available positions”.

  To ensure that the work and learning environment stays positive, Dev Bootcamp is “creating and iterating on a Code of Conduct and harassment policy that have "teeth" to deal with toxic coworkers or students”. Finally, they encourage feedback by “constantly interrogating our own propensity for microaggressive language and behavior, and giving one another timely feedback as needed.”

## How you can join

### What was the hiring process like?
  The submitter was a student before becoming a teacher.

  According to them, the “blog post [they] wrote during that time and [their] work habits in the space before they graduated” put them on the boss's radar. Then, they asked if Dev Bootcamp needed help. The submitter was hired on a 9-week contract “with the mutual intention for [them] to continue [their] web developer job search during that time”. By the end of the contract, the submitter was “offered a full time position” and chose to continue working with Dev Bootcamp over another company’s offer.
