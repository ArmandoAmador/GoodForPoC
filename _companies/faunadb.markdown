  ### How does this company ensure that employees of color are happy?

  "Everyone is given same opportunities as their peers. Right now the team is 12, so the great thing is that everyone needs to be hands on. This also allows you to be flexible in doing other things within the company, and make a valuable impact. Employee input is important and CEO/CTO rely on feedback and ideas from the group to ensure we have buy in as well as make everyone feel like they are involved with the big decisions. It's worked out well so far, and the hope is that this tradition will remain a part of the culture as we continue to grow."

### What next steps are being taken by this company to make it more diverse and inclusive?

  "The CEO came from Twitter and is very aware and focused on diversity due to such a lack of it during his time there. He doesn't want to be yet another startup with a bunch of white dudes. Focus is on bringing in more female engineers, as well as non-white employees altogether. So far the team is made of Brazilian, Hungarian, Indian, Pakistani, and White. Due to the cultural diversity already present, we have team movie nights where we watch foreign films, and try different foods on "team lunch" days. We even swap recipes. The folks here are smart and informed, well read, and are great to chat with about any topic, really. It was surprising how much they knew about my own culture, which helped me feel at home with this bunch fairly quickly. The number one thing that matters here is whether or not you can do the job well. If you need help, you'll get it, but at no point have I or anyone else I know who is non-white has felt "different" due to ethnic or cultural background."

## How you can join

### What was the hiring process like?
  "Straight forward, no tricks, honest. They do an initial screening interview, then a technical interview or equivalent if you're applying for a non-technical role, then a conversation with a senior person on the team, then a conversation with CEO or CTO (depending on role), then reference checks, then offer."
