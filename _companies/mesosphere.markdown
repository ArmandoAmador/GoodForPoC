description: "Most technology systems today are distributed systems, made up of app servers, databases, and caches. Managing distributed systems is tricky, and writing distributed systems is even trickier. Our mission is to make building and running these systems as easy as building or running an app on your smartphone."

  <h3>How does this company ensure that employees of color are happy?</h3>
  <p>“I've heard somewhere on the internet that the number one rule for hiring for your team is to not hire assholes. Since I've joined the company I've been seriously impressed by how intensely we enforce this. In the past the recruiting team have used a variety of techniques to eliminate potential offenders of the our inclusionary atmosphere, such as ensuring a woman interviewer is in a candidate's technical interview schedule to see how they treat underrepresented-people-in-tech. I have also been really impressed by how often I will hear non-poc/non-women calling out others for accidental comments that poc or women may take offense to. But even more so I've been impressed at how infrequently this type of call-out is necessary because the atmosphere is the most inclusive I have encountered out of all tech-type workplaces I have been in. I wouldn't recommend this company if I didn't honestly feel like it is a special, wonderful environment to work in the techsphere, a sentiment I feel strongly as a woman of color!”</p>

<div class="company-results_nextsteps">
  <h3>What next steps are being taken by this company to make it more diverse and inclusive?</h3>
  <p>“At our company anniversary we had an Unconference, one session of which was focused on the topic of diversity and inclusion. Recommendations brought up at the discussion include having an "unbias training" day to help people become aware of possible biases that are affect the workplace. There has also been a move to opening up the weekly important Product meeting so anyone can join and comment (very important decisions tend to be made there and historically non-leadership (and therefore women and poc) is very underrepresented) and it has been held in the public meeting-space rather than a closed room.”</p>
