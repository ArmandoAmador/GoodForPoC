  <h3>How does this company ensure that employees of color are happy?</h3>
  <p>“We have a Human Development Director that works with employees to ensure the company is more inclusive and that individuals have a strong sense of belonging and pride in themselves and their work. Not a lot of politics or hierarchy here that would put a barrier between employees and leadership. In the past, some of our employees have attended Diversity &amp; Inclusion workshops, AdColor conference, and internal workshops such as "privilege primer" and "managing inclusion." We also do a lot of community outreach, showing films like CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap, working with Women Who Code, iUrbanTeen, etc. We still have a long ways to go.”</p>
