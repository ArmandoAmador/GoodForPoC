description: "Patreon is a platform for artists and creators to fund creative projects on a recurring basis. Thousands of musicians, podcasters, video game developers, comic creators, and others are engaging and nurturing their fan-base in an intimate, immediate, and interactive way.  Whereas too many popular platforms are focused on driving down the cost of art for consumers, Patreon is dedicated to paying creators--and building a creator middle-class."

## How you can join

<div class="company-results_hiringprocess">
  <h3>What was the hiring process like?</h3>
  <p>“Every candidate is interviewed by our core behaviors team, which gauges how much of a culture add that candidate will be to Patreon. These include questions about time management, helping others, using candor, and more.  

  For engineering, our process is designed to cater toward hard skills that employees will use on the job and eliminate bias that selects for candidates from elite schools or lead us to favor those from similar backgrounds more highly. We take an attitude of treating our interviews as the beginning of a relationship rather than a hazing ritual.  

  (I am writing this as an engineer - I can't speak to the other interviews as we're going rapidly, creating new roles and the process varies from team to team)”</p>
